# Code Refactor Starter Code
This code is for a refractory challenge. It imitates a market agency that is interested in meeting accessibility standards and in turn increase their SEO.

A starter code was provided which solely used the *div* elements to separate the different entities. These were exchanged for HTML5 semantic elements such as *header*, *footer*, *section*, and *article* to help with screen readers and overall accessibility.

The code also contained multiple classes assigned to elements that were styled similarly and creating redundant code.
