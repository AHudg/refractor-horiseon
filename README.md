# Code Refactor Starter Code
This code is for a refractory challenge. It imitates a market agency that is interested in meeting accessibility standards and in turn increase their SEO.

A starter code was provided which solely used the *div* elements to separate the different entities. These were exchanged for HTML5 semantic elements such as *header*, *footer*, *section*, and *article* to help with screen readers and overall accessibility.

The code also contained multiple classes assigned to elements that were styled similarly and creating redundant code.

Lastly, the code was cleaned up, organized, and attributes were added such as:
- Added a meaningful *title* element to populate in the Tab of the user's brower
- Added *alt* to *img* elements
- Right aligning the "Online Reputation Management" article
- Fixed alignment and commented code for ease of reading
- This README.md page was updated (How meta!)
